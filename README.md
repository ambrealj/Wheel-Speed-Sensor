Worked in a team of 3 for Bruin Baja Racing Electronics to improve acceleration and handling by developing a wheel-speed monitoring system using a PID controller. Programmed feedback loops for real-time data acquisition on Arduino IDE to read in a car wheel’s RPM, integrating a geartooth sensor and a switch. Built a dashboard interface for speed visualization using an I2CLCD screen
